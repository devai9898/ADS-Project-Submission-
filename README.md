Prerequisites Installation Usage Data Sources Customization Contributing License

# Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for interactive data exploration) Python libraries (install using pip or conda): Pandas Matplotlib (for data visualization) NumPy Seaborn

# installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/devai9898/covid-vaccine-analysis.git cd covid-vaccine-analysis Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate Install the required Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
Launch the Jupyter Notebook (recommended):

jupyter notebook Navigate to the notebooks directory and open the covid_vaccine_analysis.ipynb file.

Follow the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook to run the code cells, customize the analysis, and explore the results.

If you prefer running the analysis outside of Jupyter Notebook, you can execute the Python script directly:

python covid_vaccine_analysis.py The script will generate output files and visualizations in the project directory.

# Data Sources
This project uses publicly available data from the following sources:

[https://github.com/devai9898/Ibm-ADS-COVID-vaccine-analysis-project-submission] [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress] ... Make sure to cite and reference these sources appropriately when sharing your analysis results.

# Customization
You can customize the analysis for different regions, vaccine types, or time periods by modifying the input data and parameters in the code. Refer to the Jupyter Notebook or Python script for details on how to make these customizations.

# DATA SOURCE WITH DESCRIPTION
# Introduction
This project provides code for analyzing COVID-19 vaccine data, helping users to gain insights into vaccine distribution, coverage, and effectiveness. The analysis is based on publicly available data sources and can be customized for various regions and vaccines.

# Data Sources
This project relies on the following publicly available data sources:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress OurWorldInData COVID-19 Data:

# Data Source URL:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress

# Description:
The OurWorldInData COVID-19 dataset provides comprehensive information on COVID-19 cases, vaccinations, and other related metrics worldwide. It serves as the primary data source for this analysis and is continuously updated.

# CDC COVID Data Tracker:
Data Source URL: CDC COVID Data Tracker Description: The CDC COVID Data Tracker offers detailed information on vaccination progress and COVID-19 cases in the United States. It is used to provide specific insights into vaccine distribution and coverage in the United States. Please note that these data sources may have specific terms of use, and it's essential to respect their policies and provide appropriate attribution when using their data.

# Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for interactive data exploration) Python libraries (install using pip or `conda): Pandas Matplotlib (for data visualization) NumPy Seaborn (optional but recommended for enhanced visualization)

# Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/chandrakrishnan/covid-vaccine-analysis.git cd covid-vaccine-analysis Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the required Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt The README now provides specific data sources used in the analysis, along with a brief description of their content and purpose. This information helps users understand where the data comes from and provides context for the analysis.https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress
